abstract = {Low-code is a growing development approach supported by many platforms. It fills the
gap between business and IT by supporting the active involvement of non-technical
domain experts, named Citizen Developer, in the application development lifecycle.Low-code
introduces new concepts and characteristics. However, it is not investigated yet in
academic research to point out the existing challenges and opportunities when testing
low-code software. This shortage of resources motivates this research to provide an
explicit definition to this area that we call it Low-Code Testing.In this paper, we
initially conduct an analysis of the testing components of five commercial Low-Code
Development Platforms (LCDP) to present low-code testing advancements from a business
point of view. Based on the low-code principles as well as the result of our analysis,
we propose a feature list for low-code testing along with possible values for them.
This feature list can be used as a baseline for comparing low-code testing components
and as a guideline for building new ones. Accordingly, we specify the status of the
testing components of investigated LCDPs based on the proposed features. Finally,
the challenges of low-code testing are introduced considering three concerns: the
role of citizen developer in testing, the need for high-level test automation, and
cloud testing. We provide references to the state-of-the-art to specify the difficulties
and opportunities from an academic perspective. The results of this research can be
used as a starting point for future research in low-code testing area.},
