However, for Executable Domain-Specific Languages (xDSLs), coverage metrics and associated tools are currently manually defined for each xDSL resulting in costly, error-prone, and non-reusable work. To address this problem, we propose a novel language-parametric test coverage framework for xDSLs. We define two coverage metrics adapted to xDSLs: model element and branch coverage. For performing coverage measurements, we propose a generic technique which can be used out-of-the-box by domain experts using any xDSL to define, execute, and test models. In addition, the coverage of model elements and branches can be parameterized for a given xDSL through the definition of coverage rules using a dedicated language. We showcase two test coverage applications for xDSLs: measuring the quality of test suites for executable models and localizing the models’ faults using Spectrum-Based Fault Localization techniques. We evaluate our approach using four different xDSLs. Results show that (i) we can generate meaningful coverage measurements for all investigated models, (ii) the provided coverage rule language enables framework parameterization for all xDSLs, and (iii) the computed coverage measurements are useful in identifying defects of the models.","tags":[],"title":"A language-parametric test coverage framework for executable domain-specific languages","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I obtained second place for the GDR-GPL 2022 thesis prize for my Ph.D. thesis titled \u0026ldquo;A Testing Framework for Executable Domain-Specific Languages\u0026rdquo;.

Measuring test coverage can address both concerns as it is a popular metric for test quality evaluation and, at the same time, is the foundation of advanced fault localization techniques. However, for Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs), coverage metrics and associated tools are usually manually defined for each DSL representing costly, error-prone, and non-reusable work. To address this problem, we propose a generic coverage computation and fault localization framework for DSLs. Considering a test suite executed on a model conforming to a DSL, we compute a coverage matrix based on three ingredients: the DSL specification, the coverage rules, and the model's execution trace. Using the test execution result and the computed coverage matrix, the framework calculates the suspiciousness-based ranking of the model's elements based on existing spectrum-based techniques to help the user in localizing the model's faults. We provide a tool atop the Eclipse GEMOC Studio and evaluate our approach using four different DSLs, with 297 test cases for 21 models in total.","tags":[],"title":"From Coverage Computation to Fault Localization: A Generic Framework for Domain-Specific Languages","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"In the 25th edition of the MODELS conference, I will take part in several roles.

Some behavioral models are reactive, meaning that during their execution, they accept external events and react by exposing events to the external environment. Since complex interaction may occur between the reactive model and the external environment, they should be tested as early as possible to ensure the correctness of their behavior. In this paper, we propose a set of generic testing facilities for reactive xDSLs using the standardized Test Description Language (TDL). Given a reactive xDSL, we generate a TDL library enabling the domain experts to write and run event-driven TDL test cases for conforming reactive models. To further support the domain expert, the approach integrates interactive debugging to help in localizing defects, and mutation analysis to measure the quality of test cases.We evaluate the level of genericity of the approach by successfully writing, executing, and analyzing 247 event-driven TDL test cases for 70 models conforming to two different reactive xDSLs.","tags":[],"title":"Advanced Testing and Debugging Support for Reactive Executable DSLs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Faezeh Khorram","Erwan Bousse","Jean-Marie Mottu","Gerson Sunyé","Pablo Gómez-Abajo","Pablo C.Cañizares","Esther Guerra","Juan de Lara"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1657670400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1657670400,"objectID":"96d8d9c5ba4ed26cf59aeee3536e2bc0","permalink":"https://Faezeh-Kh.github.io/publication/models22/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/models22/","section":"publication","summary":"Behavioral models are important assets that must be thoroughly verified early in the design process. This can be achieved with manuallywritten test cases that embed carefully hand-picked domain-specific input data. However, such test cases may not always reach the desired level of quality, such as high coverage or being able to localize faults efficiently. Test amplification is an interesting emergent approach to improve a test suite by automatically generating new test cases out of existing manually-written ones. Yet, while ad-hoc test amplification solutions have been proposed for a few programming languages, no solution currently exists for amplifying the test cases of behavioral models. In this paper, we fill this gap with an automated and generic approach. Given an executable DSL, a conforming behavioral model, and an existing test suite, the proposed approach generates new regression test cases in three steps: (i) generating new test inputs by applying a set of generic modifiers on the existing test inputs; (ii) running the model under test with new inputs and generating assertions from the execution traces; and (iii) selecting the new test cases that increase the mutation score. We provide tool support for the approach atop the Eclipse GEMOC Studio and show its applicability in an empirical study. In the experiment, we applied the approach to 71 test suites written for models conforming to two different DSLs, and for 67 of the 71 cases, it successfully improved the mutation score between 3.17% and 54.11% depending on the initial setup.","tags":[],"title":"Automatic Test Amplification for Executable Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1657011600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1657011600,"objectID":"b05dd72c4de964195d4b8d8860a1dec1","permalink":"https://Faezeh-Kh.github.io/talk/student-volunteer-in-staf-2022/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/student-volunteer-in-staf-2022/","section":"event","summary":"Participant in STAF 2022 conference as a student volunteer","tags":[],"title":"Student Volunteer in STAF 2022","type":"event"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"I was a visiting researcher in the Miso research group of Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (Madrid, Spain), working on automatic test amplification for executable models.

While a large number of testing frameworks exist for general-purpose programming languages, providing testing facilities for any given executable Domain Specific Language (xDSL) remains a costly and challenging task. In this context, a standard such as the Test Description Language (TDL) appears as a suitable foundation for the definition of a generic testing approach for xDSLs. Unfortunately, TDL does not provide the domain-specific concepts required to write test cases for a given xDSL and does not include any model execution facilities. Our contribution addresses these limitations and thereby provides a fully generic testing approach for xDSLs based on TDL. Required TDL domain-specific concepts are automatically inferred from the xDSL definition through a model transformation into TDL. Model execution facilities are provided through the definition of a refined operational semantics for TDL. The application of our approach on 5 different xDSLs shows its generality and that it can successfully be used for testing executable models.# Summary.

Low-code introduces new concepts and characteristics. However, it is not investigated yet in academic research to point out the existing challenges and opportunities when testing low-code software. This shortage of resources motivates this research to provide an explicit definition to this area that we call it Low-Code Testing. In this paper, we initially conduct an analysis of the testing components of five commercial Low-Code Development Platforms (LCDP) to present low-code testing advancements from a business point of view. Based on the low-code principles as well as the result of our analysis, we propose a feature list for low-code testing along with possible values for them. This feature list can be used as a baseline for comparing low-code testing components and as a guideline for building new ones. Accordingly, we specify the status of the testing components of investigated LCDPs based on the proposed features. Finally, the challenges of low-code testing are introduced considering three concerns: the role of citizen developer in testing, the need for high-level test automation, and cloud testing. We provide references to the state-of-the-art to specify the difficulties and opportunities from an academic perspective.
